# stringGeneticAlgorithm
Made a simple genetic algorithm using strings too match a certain input string

### Basic Idea
For those who don't know, a gentic algorithm is a randomized algorithm that uses ideas from evolutionary biology to come to either an exact solution or an approximate one.

The basic idea is that we start with a population of random candidate solutions(or agents) that have a notion of fitness, or how good of a solution the agent is. Like in evoutionary biology, the most fit live to survive and they breed to make new children(a new population) who have their genetic traits. There is also an element of random mutation that could occur in the offspring to bring novel genetic information. The system continues to produce new children with greater and greater improved fitness until a good enough approximate solution is found or the exact solution is found.
